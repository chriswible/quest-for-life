Crowdsourcing the Drake Equation

##################################

This project was a lot of fun. 
I'm officially HAML, SASS, and git convert after working on this.

According to the instructions, the charts reflect actual data in the database. 
The user can view charts by two demographic parameters (age and gender). 
This works for all parameters, via ajax - or without javascript in an accessible table.
Plot lines are added to the chart to represent the average response for
the current parameter, as well as the current user's estimate if they've
completed the survey.

I completely rewrote the surveys controller to no longer use make_resourceful,
which I found was a pretty nifty tool in itself. I maintained the @current_object
and @current_objects names to adhere to the rest of the view's expecations.

Current code passes all existing tests with the exception of the fact that
I changed the survey_controller's index test as index functions differently now.

Also worth noting, the entire site has been tweaked to be accessible without
javascript. All forms and buttons, and selects degrade gracefully.

I honestly would have loved to continue with this project, I have a lot of things
I'd like to do - it was a lot of fun.
