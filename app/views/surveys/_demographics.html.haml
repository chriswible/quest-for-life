    We use basic information about you to learn how different people feel about the Drake Equation. Your teacher has already told us where you live (#{@current_object.address}) and how hold you are (#{@current_object.age_group.description}). Please tell us your gender so you can see if gender makes a difference in your class results.

    In addition to teaching a little science, we hope to learn more about how different people around the world think about this issue. Please tell us a little about yourself so that we can compare your responses with others.
